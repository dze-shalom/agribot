##  How to Test

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have all required packages:

```bash
pip install reportlab pillow matplotlib flask-cors
```

Or install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

**IMPORTANT:** Use the full application, not the simple test server!

```bash
# Use this (CORRECT):
python start_server.py

# Or:
python -m app.main

# NOT this (old test server):
python run.py  # ❌ Don't use this!
```

### Step 3: Access the Admin Dashboard

1. Go to: http://localhost:5000/login.html
2. Login as admin
3. You'll be redirected to: http://localhost:5000/analytics.html

### Step 4: Generate PDF Report

**Option 1: From Dashboard (Top Right)**
- Click the " Generate Report" button in the top-right corner

**Option 2: From Reports Tab**
- Navigate to "Reports & Exports" tab
- Click "Generate" next to "Analytics Report"

**Option 3: Using Export Modal**
- Click "Export Data" button in header
- Select "Analytics Data"
- Choose "PDF" format (if available)

##  Expected Output

The PDF will include:

1. **Cover Page** with branding and metadata
2. **Executive Dashboard** with KPIs
3. **Visualizations** (4 charts with insights)
4. **Detailed Analytics** tables
5. **Top Crops Analysis** with rankings
6. **Actionable Recommendations** (priority-based)
7. **Executive Summary** with next steps
8. **Professional Footer**

##  Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Download is still the same"
**Solution:** Make sure you restarted the server after the code changes!

```bash
# Stop the server (CTRL+C)
# Then restart with:
python start_server.py
```

### Issue: "PDF generation failed"
**Possible causes:**
1. Missing dependencies: `pip install reportlab pillow matplotlib`
2. Running old `run.py` instead of `app/main.py`
3. Server not restarted after code changes

### Issue: "No data in charts"
**This is normal if:**
- The database is empty or has minimal data
- The report will show "No data available yet" messages
- Charts will still be generated with placeholder content

### Issue: "Route not found"
**Check that:**
1. You're running the full app (`start_server.py` or `python -m app.main`)
2. The route `/admin/analytics/export` appears in the startup logs
3. You're logged in as an admin user

##  Testing with Sample Data

If you want to see a report with actual data, you can:

1. Create some test users
2. Have conversations in the chatbot
3. Submit some feedback
4. Then generate the report

##  What Makes This Report Special?

Unlike basic reports, this one:
- **Communicates insights** - not just raw numbers
- **Includes visualizations** - charts tell the story
- **Provides recommendations** - actionable next steps
- **Professional formatting** - presentation-ready
- **Data-driven** - every metric is analyzed and contextualized

##  Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the server console for error messages
2. Verify all routes are registered: Look for `admin.export_analytics_data: /admin/analytics/export`
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Ensure you're using POST method for the export endpoint

##  Customization

To customize the report, edit:
- `app/routes/admin.py` - Line 628 onwards (generate_comprehensive_pdf_report function)
- `app/routes/report_charts.py` - Chart generation functions

Enjoy your enhanced analytics reports!
